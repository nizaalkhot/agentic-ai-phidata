This repository leverages **Phidata** to create intelligent agents capable of solving specific tasks autonomously. These agents integrate seamlessly with data pipelines, APIs, and workflows, enabling efficient automation and decision-making.

## Features

- **Agent Frameworks**: Implement AI agents using modern libraries (e.g., OpenAI, LangChain).
- **Pipeline Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with Phidata's data pipelines.
- **Custom Workflows**: Build reusable workflows tailored to your use case.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Run agents locally or deploy on cloud environments using Phidata.
